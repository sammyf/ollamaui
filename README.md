# Ollamaui

This code comes with no guarantee whatsoever. You'll need to have an ollama server running under the 
same URL to bypass CORS, and if you use the companion app it will need to use the same URL too.

Just to be clear : this is just something I barfed out to get to speed with Angular18, so much is left 
to be desired in the way things are done and once I have the skills I need I might just drop the project
alltogether. So don't expect help running it or me fixing issues you find. If you like it then I really 
encourage you to fork it and work on it yourself. Coding is a fun activity when it's raining outside.

No tests included as of yet. Working on them.


Just leaving the automatically generated stuff here, as it might help you out a bit.
